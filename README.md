# Open Tree of Life script-managed trees
This directory is intended to hold large trees that are input to synthesis but are not
    in phylesystem because:
  1. Their large size makes manual curation in the curator app infeasible,
  2. Their large size makes storage in NexSON a poor choice,
  3. The entirely automated way of managing them calls requires no curation app.


# TODO
Lots todo..

  1. We probably want to create a phylesystem stub for each of these resources so that they:
    1. are more visible to users,
    2. can be ranked using the collections mechanism,
    3. can be indexed by OTI.
    4. can have their citations managed in a non ad hoc manner.
  2. We need to figure out where we will clone this repo on https://files.opentreeoflife.org
  3. Perhaps rethink this strategy of managing the files in a big git repo.
